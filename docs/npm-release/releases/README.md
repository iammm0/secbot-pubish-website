# Release Notes

This page is curated from the first-parent commit timeline of the sibling `secbot` repository, especially the `npm-release` and historical `pypi-release` lines. It records the product evolution from the early pure Python implementation, through the TUI rewrite, the full TypeScript rewrite, and the current MCP / Skills / security-tool surface.

Current npm line: `2.0.0-b2`.

## Product Timeline

### 2025-12-29: Pure Python prototype

The repository started as a Python security-agent project. The first commit batch added the base project configuration, core agent modules, database and prompt management, crawler / scanner modules, defense controllers, system tools, CLI entry points, documentation, tests, Docker deployment files, exploit modules, attack-chain automation, payload generation, and penetration-testing CLI commands.

Representative commits: `7544527`, `37e48c0`, `52f9037`, `3ba26ce`, `24c988f`, `85fb9ce`, `e702559`, `645f334`, `46a5a58`.

### 2026-02-06 to 2026-02-11: Python security workflow takes shape

The Python line gained audit/session persistence, a broader security tool set, a security ReAct pattern, Hackbot / SuperHackbot agents, slash commands, confirmation/audit utilities, Web research tooling, root-permission policy, API routing, mobile experiments, and a reorganized core package.

Representative commits: `479637a`, `47742c7`, `93d4fd9`, `e44b77b`, `05c79aa`, `0cb8416`, `3967bcb`, `f0945e3`, `2de404b`.

### 2026-02-09 to 2026-03-24: TUI rewrite and multi-client experiments

The TUI line began with the event bus, terminal UI module, status components, session management, enhanced block rendering, model selection, shared interaction components, FastAPI/SSE routing, Expo mobile experiments, Tauri desktop experiments, and packaging work for standalone executables.

Representative commits: `2dbcaf0`, `d621cc6`, `fa1082b`, `207e169`, `3967bcb`, `5004418`, `68f1c54`, `f37fb72`, `eca3fd8`.

### 2026-03-11 to 2026-04-03: Public Python releases

The project moved through `v1.0.0` to `v1.10.0`: the CLI package was stabilized, the project was renamed to Secbot, keyring and SQLite-backed configuration landed, LLM fallback and terminal improvements were added, desktop/mobile UI experiments matured, and release workflows were iterated.

Key tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`, `v1.2.0`, `v1.3.0`, `v1.4.0`, `v1.5.0`, `v1.6.0`, `v1.6.1`, `v1.8.0`, `v1.9.0`, `v1.10.0`.

### 2026-04-04 to 2026-04-06: Complete TypeScript rewrite

The `npm-release` line replaced the Python runtime with a pure TypeScript stack. The runtime moved to a NestJS backend, Ink terminal UI, Node.js system APIs, TypeScript build/test/lint pipelines, npm package publishing, and `@opensec/secbot` release automation.

Representative commits: `28a26d9`, `fdf46fb`, `ad425a5`, `bd12195`, `4163209`, `4933ca0`, `d499b7f`.

### 2026-04-07 to 2026-04-17: npm product hardening and beta release

The TS line added local child-process backend spawning, service/remote backend modes, `/model` configuration flow, HTTP/SSE error mapping, ask/agent context wiring, persistent TUI conversations, Trusted Publishing, and the `v2.0.0-b1` npm beta.

Representative commits: `951d20c`, `684bd56`, `6266eec`, `f6a2794`, `58257c7`, `728c3e2`, `b3f2456`, `2f83911`.

### 2026-05-12 to 2026-05-29: Agent mode, MCP wrapping, Skills, and security-tool integration

Current `2.0.0-b2` work unified chat into Agent mode, added live QA retrieval, introduced `IntentRouter`, `ExploreAgent`, and `ContextManager`, integrated the MCP server / `secbot-mcp` entry point, added Skills APIs and Skills tools, packaged the Web UI, added an ExecGo control bridge, and improved terminal report rendering.

The current tool surface contains 82 TypeScript tools across Security, Defense, Utility, Protocol, OSINT, Cloud, Reporting, Crawler, Web Research, MCP, Skills, Control, and Vuln DB categories.

Representative commits: `3dfbb5d`, `8606cc5`, `3d2bb21`, `e8b8516`, `3903ee2`, `ba3466f`, `46a28c0`, `e6b5a98`.
